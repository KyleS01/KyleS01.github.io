Kavar is my current project that I've been working on for a little while now. It is going to have features found in roguelikes such as:
1. Permadeath (I am thinking about making this optional)
2. Procedural Generation with Perlin Noise
3. Randomized item and enemy stats with bonus effects.
4. And turn based movement.

&nbsp;

I haven't thought a great deal about what I want to be included within the game but I have decieded that I want it to be a survival game. These means the player would have to deal with hunger, health, and other elements that may try to kill you -the player-. It will also be set in a fantasy-like world meaning it will have inhuman beings such as Rock monsters that will try to crush you.

Most of the dev-logs here will be about Kavar and you can espect a lot of me babbling about whats being added and improved on within the game.

The first dev-log of Kavar can be found here: [Kavar Dev Log 0](https://kyles01.github.io/introduction/2020/06/10/Kavar-Log-0.html).
