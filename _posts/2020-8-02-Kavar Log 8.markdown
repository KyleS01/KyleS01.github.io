Welcome to Log 8 of Kavar. This week was spent revamping the movement system so that it would be easier to accomplish what I have in mind. Last week’s goal was to allow the enemy to lose the player if they left their POV. This was not accomplished however since the way I had designed my previous movement system made it very difficult and unclean to implement it in. Because of that, I’ve decided that instead of being a turn-based game where the player would move before all of the enemies, the player and enemies would move in real time. As I want Kavar to be a strategy game of sorts where the player will look at their enemies and determine the best approach to deal with them, I am going to implement a pause option that will stop all movement of the player and enemies so that it will become easier to plan out. 
Since the movement has now been updated to run in real time, my next step is to accomplish what I set out to do last week. Hopefully this time will go more smoothly. Until then stay safe.
