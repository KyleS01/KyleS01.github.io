Hey and welcome to the official page of Kavar. Kavar is going to be a roguelike that features dynamic enemies, allies, and worlds that interact with each other. Ever wanted enemies that hate specific people and monsters and will target them instead of you. Ever wanted to gain the trust of your ally only to find out he’s been stealing gold from you this entire time. Ever wanted to see giant rock monsters get destroyed by tiny acidic spiders. Well have I got the game for you. 
These features and more what could you want? Oh, the game… right.

&nbsp;

As it stands, Kavar is new. Pretty much baby new. Which is why I invite you, random stranger over the internet, to come with me on a grand adventure on which I develop Kavar one feature at a time. There will be times be a week will bring chest loads of features ready to release, and other weeks where I’ll fix a simple bug haunting me only to find out I’ve put a while loop in the update function again (damn those while loops). No matter the weather, I hope you enjoy the weekly dev-logs I intend to do and with any luck you will somehow enjoy what I have to offer.

&nbsp;

With all that said, thank you and enjoy the ride!
