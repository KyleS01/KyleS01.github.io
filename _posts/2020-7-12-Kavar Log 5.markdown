This week’s dev log is going to be quite short as its only about one topic; the pathfinding for the enemies. It’s been a difficult to implement this in and even though I spent the entire week trying to do so, it is still in the process of working. Because of this, I can’t actually show you anything. I can however talk about the pathfinding itself.
For those who don’t know, pathfinding is a method used by programmers to give logic to enemies so that they can move around a level without colliding into walls or other objects. Its very handy for games that don’t have a definite level layout such as Kavar as the entire map is going to be procedural generated.
There are many algorithms used for pathfinding but the one I’m using is A*. This is the one of the most popular and most used algorithms as its simple to use and understand. 
If you’re interested in the logic behind it watch this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE">Sebastian Lague.</a>

The first video goes over the process and logic of A Star. The rest involve implementing A Star in Unity using a custom-made grid system. Right now, I’m in the process of converting the grid system to Unity’s inbuild grid.
Wells that everything for this week. Hope you enjoyed and until next time stay safe.
