Two things this week. I’ve updated graphics for Kavar to Kenney’s 1-bit pack and replaced all of the ground and wall sprites with that, and I’ve started with map generation. 
This week was mostly just looking at how to do map gen in Unity and looking over other people’s projects to see how they handled it. 
I also experimented a bit with Perlin Noise within Unity and while I do get visual results, they don’t look entirely appealing.

As you can see, there are parts of the generation that get duplicated. I’m not entirely sure for the reasoning of this but, I suspect it’s something to do with how I’m handling chunks. Currently how this works is that a chunk, which contains 16x16 area of tiles, gets generated with noise, and then the next chunk gets generated with the same noise causing different chunks to get the same noise. I might be wrong but currently that’s the only issue with this.
Anyway, for now, I’m going to focus on generating nice looking environments with trees and water. After that will come interaction with environments for the player and finding a way to spawn enemies.
Well until next time stay safe.
