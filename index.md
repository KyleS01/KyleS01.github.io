Welcome to Kyle’s official website. This website will be updated weekly with any progress I make on my projects alongside with my thoughts on how it went making and implementing that feature. These dev-logs will mainly focus on the features I have added and my thought process on how I went about handling it. Some posts may include code-snippets which will be used to explain the way I created a feature. Don’t worry though, if you aren’t a programmer you won’t have to worry about scrolling through large chunks of code. So, if you like reading dev-logs and enjoy what I have to offer, perhaps considering the possibility of visiting my website next week. Until then.
